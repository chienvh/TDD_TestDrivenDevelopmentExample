This contains the things to let you know what is test driven development

This video shows you:
- What is TDD?
- How to use TDD?
- When will we use TDD?

------------------------------------------------------------
The fundamental steps of a TDD iteration:
------------------------------------------------------------
- RED: take a piece of functionality and build a test for it and make it fail the test by writing a minimum amount of code(basically just get it to compile and run the test).

- GREEN: write minimal code for the test to make it succeed.

- REFACTOR: clean up and reorganize the code and ensure it passes the test and any previous tests.
